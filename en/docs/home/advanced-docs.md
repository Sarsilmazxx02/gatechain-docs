   - **Connect**： A full node can connect to the public mainnet (using the same network version)<!--，Latest code[get](pending developing)here-->）to monitor and broadcast transactions, update blocks and other network tasks in real time.
   - **CLI**：Client programs which can interact with GateChain using the command line interface are also provided.
