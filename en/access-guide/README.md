## Access Guide


In order to enable users and developers to seamlessly migrate ETH products to GateChain without any costs, we have upgraded the current GateChain account based on the Gatemint consensus and added a new EVM-Account type. An EVM-Account is synced with ETH in terms of usage, format, and security and users don’t even need to create a new account on GateChain.

GateChain is fully compatible with Ethereum’s eco products such as MetaMask and other browser wallets, Remix and other development tools, which can be easily accessed to help users explore the world of DeFi stress-free. Any smart contract that runs normally on Ethereum can be seamlessly deployed to run on GateChain.
