<!--In  terms of academic research,  GateChain’s main invention is an on-chain “Vault Account”, which  has important safe features to restore lost private key and revoke  stolen asset, providing a novel  solution to blockchain asset safety for individuals,  enterprises and banks,where asset safety is sensitive.   Research shows that by linearly adding the revocable delay time and the cascaded Vault Accounts , safety increases exponentially. In practice, it can  completely solve the  blockchain asset safe storage  problems for both individual and banks.  Academic research is available to view later.-->


The major innovation of GateChain is that it put forward and implemented   an  on-chain “Vault Account” . This type of account has safety features allowing for revocable transaction and damaged private key restoration, thus providing a novel blockchain safety solution to individuals, enterprises and asset sensitive banks.  Research shows that by linearly adding the revocable delay time or cascaded vault accounts, the safety performance increases exponentially. In practice, Vault Account  essentially solves the safety problems  in on-chain trading and management  for individuals and banks.


## Research Papers

GateChain currently  have 2 completed research papers and  1 in progress paper.  All the papers will be available to view when they are published. Stay tuned.

## Mainnet Architecture

<!--At its early stage, GateChain mainnet  developed a UTXO underlying architecture and built the vault account model on top of it  to  verify the prototype.It also  made an academic research paper around  Vault Account based on UTXO model (will publish later).Later, to better support cross-chain ecosystem,  Gatechain migrated to  a blockchain underlying architecture built on top of Tendermint. Leveraging  account models directly  and innovation on upper layer protocols,it centers its focus on implementing the  Vault Account  that has  revocable transaction and clearing features and develops the DEX  settlement features. It builds a complete application layer and provides standard interfaces to meet a variety of demands from upper layer applications.   GateChain also offers developer tools  like offline  account generation and transaction singing libraries using SDK, making  third-party development more simple.-->

At its early stage, GateChain mainnet  implemented its Vault Account model based on a UTXO underlying architecture  and finished prototype verification. The work has been adopted in the industry and formed a research paper “Research and Study of Vault Account based on UTXO Model”（Pending publishing)

Later, to support  better compatibility in cross-chain ecosystem,  Gatechain migrated to  a blockchain underlying architecture built on top of Tendermint. The new architecture  leverages account models directly. With  innovation on upper protocols, it focuses  on implementing  Vault Account  allowing for  revocable transaction and clearing features. It has also developed  the DEX  settlement features. In the application layer, the new architecture supports standard interfaces that can meet various demands from upper layer applications and it  also offers offline  account generation and transaction singing libraries using SDK, providing convenient developer tools for third-party ecosystem applications development.
